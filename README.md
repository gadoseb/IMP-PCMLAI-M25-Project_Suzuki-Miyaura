# IMP-PCMLAI-M25-Project_Suzuki-Miyaura

Suzuki-Miyaura coupling is a popular and widely used chemical reaction that allows for the formation of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds between aryl or vinyl halides and boronic acids or boronate esters. This reaction is a type of cross-coupling reaction, which involves the merging of two different organic molecules to create a new compound with a C-C bond (Scheme 1).

The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction was first reported by Akira Suzuki and Norio Miyaura in the 1970s and has since become a fundamental tool in organic synthesis, particularly in the field of medicinal chemistry and materials science. It is known for its mild reaction conditions, high functional group tolerance, and broad substrate scope, making it applicable to a wide range of organic molecules.
The reaction typically involves the use of a palladium catalyst, along with a base and a source of boron, such as a boronic acid or boronate ester. The reaction proceeds through a transmetalation step, where the palladium catalyst facilitates the transfer of an aryl or vinyl group from the boron source to the halide substrate, forming a C-C bond in the process.
The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction has been used in the synthesis of numerous complex organic molecules, including natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. It has enabled chemists to efficiently create C-C bonds in a controlled and selective manner, making it a valuable tool in modern organic chemistry.
